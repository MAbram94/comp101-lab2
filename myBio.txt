My name is Mise'l Abram and I am a 31 year-old gay man and returning 4th year student, completing my Bachelor of Motion Picture Arts degree. I was born and raised in the Indigenous Canadian reservation of Millbrook First Nation. Since as long as I can remember living, I have been passionate about the dramatic arts, cinema and filmmaking. I have produced Telus Storyhive funded 10-minute short film called "Drift Softly" (2016), I was the Associate Producer on a 100-minute feature film called "River of Silence" (2017), and I was a Supervising Producer on the  "Indian Road Trip" (2019). Just this year, I completed writing my first feature film called "The Savage" which is a 157 page screenplay.
